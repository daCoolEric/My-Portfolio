            <h3>I’m Eric Kodzo Ayi, but you can just call me Eric.</h3>
            <h3>
              Originally hailing from Ghana. For the past 5 years, I’ve been
              honing my skills in UI/UX design, graphic design, web development,
              social media marketing and software development.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="last_h3">
              I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight
              users, while keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for
              implementation, scalability and developer sanity.<img />
            </h3>
            <h3 class="last_h3">
              I am so passionate about using computational methods to solve
              societal problems. I aspire to dive so deep into technology as I
              believe that it runs the very essence of our lives. In present
              times, I have found myself having a great interest in distributed
              systems and embedded systems. I'm also interested in data
              structures and algorithms for solving social problems, design
              patterns, and clean coding.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="last_h3">
              My present experience enables me to build webpages, web apps and
              native apps from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js,
              Redux, Node.js, Express.js and many more. I'm a very vivid
              visualizer who believe that if you can see it, you can create it.
              I spend most of my time thinking and visualizing the solution to a
              problem before I start coding or implementing it.
